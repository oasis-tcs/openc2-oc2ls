#### Abstract:
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyberdefense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine to machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. It should be understood that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated cyber responses that occur within cyber relevant time. Other aspects of coordinated cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.

# 1 Introduction
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a command is encoded by an OpenC2 producer (managing application) and transferred to an OpenC2 consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol. The consumer can respond with status and any requested information.  The contents of both the command and the response are fully defined in schemas, allowing both parties to recognize the syntax constraints imposed on the exchange.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices.  These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device.  The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established.

## 1.2 Terminology
* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed.
* **Actuator**: The entity that performs the action.
* **Command**: A message defined by an action-target pair that is sent from a producer and received by a consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives commands.  Note that a single device / application can have both consumer and producer capabilities.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends commands.
* **Response**: A message from a consumer to a producer acknowledging a command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received request.
* **Target**: The object of the action, i.e., the action is performed on the target.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] and [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)].

## 1.6 Overview
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications to command actuators that execute cyber defense functions in an unambiguous, standardized way.  These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications.  The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the standard at the producer and consumer of the command and response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.

* The OpenC2 Language Specification provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for commands and responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the command or response.
* OpenC2 Actuator Profiles specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely) to implement multiple actuator profiles.  Actuator profiles extend the language by defining specifiers that identify the actuator to the required level of precision and may define command arguments that are relevant and/or unique to those actuator functions.
* OpenC2 Transfer Specifications utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transfer of OpenC2 messages.

The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  A message consists of a header and a payload (_defined_ as a message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and _specified_ in one or more actuator profiles). 

In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:

1. **OpenC2 Producers**: An OpenC2 Producer is an entity that creates commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the command. An OpenC2 Producer may receive and process responses in conjunction with a command.
2. **OpenC2 Consumers**: An OpenC2 Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon an OpenC2 command.  An OpenC2 Consumer may create responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the OpenC2 Producer. 

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the OpenC2 "Producer", to one or more systems, the OpenC2 "Consumer(s)", to act on the content of the command.
2. **Response**: Any information captured or necessary to send back to the OpenC2 Producer  that issued the Command, i.e., the OpenC2 Consumerâs response to the OpenC2 Producer.

**Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude the use of any particular protocol or standard.

![no alt title](images/image_2.png)

**Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.

**Table 1-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>(standard and extensions) |
| Common Content | Language Specification<br>(this document) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>(OpenC2-over-HTTPS, OpenC2-over-CoAP, â¦) |
| Secure Transfer | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transfer** layer provides a communication path between the producer and the consumer.  OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transfer protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transfer- and content-independent mechanism for conveying requests, responses, and notifications.  A transfer specification maps transfer-specific protocol elements to a transfer-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.  
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of OpenC2 commands and responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function.  An actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function.  OpenC2 Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.

## 1.7 Goal
The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD](#iacd)]:

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action 

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions.  OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/ analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guides the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and product agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  An OpenC2 command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  OpenC2 commands and responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of actions and targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

## 1.8 Purpose and Scope
The OpenC2 Language Specification defines the set of components to assemble a complete command and control message and provides a framework so that the language can be extended. To achieve this purpose, the scope of this specification includes:

1. the set of actions and options that may be used in OpenC2 commands
2. the set of targets and target specifiers
3. a syntax that defines the structure of commands and responses
4. a JSON serialization of OpenC2 commands and responses
5. the procedures for extending the language

The OpenC2 language assumes that the event has been detected, a decision to act has been made, the act is warranted, and the initiator and recipient of the commands are authenticated and authorized. The OpenC2 language was designed to be agnostic of the other aspects of cyber defense implementations that realize these assumptions. The following items are beyond the scope of this specification:

1. Language extensions applicable to some actuators, which may be defined in individual actuator profiles.
2. Alternate serializations of OpenC2 commands and responses.
3. The enumeration of the protocols required for transport, information assurance, sensing, analytics and other external dependencies.

# 2 OpenC2 Language Description
The OpenC2 language has two distinct content types: command and response. The command is sent from a producer to a consumer and describes an action to be performed by an actuator on a target. The response is sent from a consumer, usually back to the producer, and is a means to provide information (such as acknowledgement, status, etc.) as a result of a command.

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command
The command describes an action to be performed on a target and may include information identifying the actuator or actuators that are to execute the command. 

A command has four main components: ACTION, TARGET, ARGUMENTS, and ACTUATOR. The following list summarizes the components of a command. 

* **ACTION** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **TARGET** (required): The object of the action. The ACTION is performed on the target.
    * **TARGET-NAME** (required): The name of the object of the action.
    * **TARGET-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier further identifies the target to some level of precision, such as a specific target, a list of targets, or a class of targets.
* **ARGUMENTS** (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration etc.
* **ACTUATOR** (optional): The ACTUATOR executes the command (the ACTION and TARGET). The ACTUATOR type will be defined within the context of an Actuator Profile.
    * **ACTUATOR-NAME** (required): The name of the set of functions (e.g., "slpf") performed by the actuator, and the name of the profile defining commands applicable to those functions.
    * **ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier identifies the actuator to some level of precision, such as a specific actuator, a list of actuators, or a group of actuators.

The ACTION and TARGET components are required and are populated by one of the actions in [Section 3.3.1.1](#3311-action) and the targets in [Section 3.3.1.2](#3312-target). A particular target may be further refined by one or more TARGET-SPECIFIERS. Procedures to extend the targets are described in [Section 3.3.4](#334-extensions).

TARGET-SPECIFIERS provide additional precision to identify the target (e.g., 10.1.2.3) and may include a method of identifying multiple targets of the same type (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16).

The ARGUMENTS component, if present, is populated by one or more 'command arguments' that determine how the command is executed. ARGUMENTS influence the command by providing information such as time, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to convey the need for acknowledgement or additional status information about the execution of a command. The valid ARGUMENTS defined in this specification are in [Section 3.3.1.4](#3314-command-arguments).

An ACTUATOR is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the command. An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of ACTIONS, TARGETS and other aspects of this language specification that are mandatory to implement or optional in the context of a particular ACTUATOR. An Actuator Profile may extend the language by defining additional ARGUMENTS, ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS, and/or TARGETS that are meaningful and possibly unique to the actuator.

The ACTUATOR optionally identifies the entity or entities that are tasked to execute the command. Specifiers for actuators refine the command so that a particular function, system, class of devices, or specific device can be identified. 

The ACTUATOR component may be omitted from a command and typically will not be included in implementations where the identities of the endpoints are unambiguous or when a high-level effects-based command is desired and the tactical decisions on how the effect is achieved is left to the recipient.  

## 2.2 OpenC2 Response
The OpenC2 Response is a message sent from the recipient of a command. Response messages provide acknowledgement, status, results from a query, or other information.

The following list summarizes the fields and subfields of an OpenC2 Response. 

* **STATUS** (required): An integer containing a numerical status code
* **STATUS_TEXT** (optional): A free-form string containing human-readable description of the response status. The string can contain more detail than is represented by the status code, but does not affect the meaning of the response.
* **RESULTS** (optional): Contains the data or extended status code that was requested from an OpenC2 Command.

# 3 OpenC2 Language Definition 
## 3.1 Base Components and Structures
### 3.1.1 Data Types
The syntax of valid OpenC2 messages is defined using an information model constructed from the data types presented here:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primitive Types** |   |
| Binary | A sequence of octets.  Length is the number of octets. |
| Boolean | A logical entity that can have two values: `true` and `false`. |
| Integer | A whole number. |
| Number | A real number. |
| Null | Nothing, used to designate fields with no value. |
| String | A sequence of characters. Each character must have a valid Unicode codepoint.  Length is the number of characters. |
| **Structures** |   |
| Array | An ordered list of unnamed fields. Each field has an ordinal position and type. |
| ArrayOf | An ordered list of unnamed fields of the same type. Each field has an ordinal position and the specified type. |
| Choice | One field selected from a set of named fields. The value has a name and type. |
| Enumerated | A set of id:name pairs where id is an integer. The Enumerated.ID subtype is a set of ids only. |
| Map | An unordered set of named fields. Each field has an id, name and type. |
| Record | An ordered list of named fields, e.g. a message, record, structure, or row in a table. Each field has an ordinal position, name, and type. |

### 3.1.2 Derived Data Types
The following types are defined as value constraints applied to String (text string), Binary (octet string) or Integer values.  The serialized representation of the base types is specified in [Section 3.1.5](#315-serialization), but there are no restrictions on how derived types are represented internally by an implementation. 

| Type | Base | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Domain-Name | String | RFC 1034 Section 3.5 |
| Date-Time | Integer | Milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970. |
| Duration | Integer | Milliseconds. |
| Email-Addr | String | RFC 5322 Section 3.4.1 |
| Identifier | String | (TBD rules, e.g., initial alpha followed by alphanumeric or underscore) |
| IP-Addr | Binary | 32 bit IPv4 address or 128 bit IPv6 address |
| MAC-Addr | Binary | Media Access Control / Extended Unique Identifier address - EUI-48 or EUI-64. |
| Port | Integer | 16 bit RFC 6335 Transport Protocol Port Number |
| Request-Id | Binary | A value of up to 128 bits |
| URI | String | RFC 3986 |
| UUID | Binary | 128 bit Universal Unique Identifier, RFC 4122 Section 4 |

### 3.1.3 Cardinality
Property tables for types based on Array, Choice, Map and Record include a cardinality column (#) that specifies the minimum and maximum number of values of a field.  The most commonly used cardinalities are:

* 1	Required and not repeatable
* 0..1	Optional and not repeatable
* 1..n	Required and repeatable
* 0..n	Optional and repeatable

The cardinality column may also specify a range of sizes, e.g.,:

* 3..5	Required and repeatable with a minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 values

### 3.1.4 Derived Enumerations
An Enumerated field may be derived ("auto-generated") from the fields of a Choice, Map or Record type by appending ".*" to the type name.

**_Type: Example-sel (Record)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | targets | Target.* | 1..n | Enumeration auto-generated from a Choice |

### 3.1.5 Serialization
OpenC2 is agnostic of any particular serialization; however, implementations MUST support JSON serialization in accordance with RFC 7493 and additional requirements specified in the following table.

**JSON Serialization Requirements:**

| OpenC2 Data Type | JSON Serialization Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Binary** | JSON **string** containing Base64url encoding of the binary value as defined in Section 5 of RFC 4648. |
| **Binary.x** | JSON **string** containing Base16 (hex) encoding of a binary value as defined in Section 8 of RFC 4648. Note that the Base16 alphabet does not include lower-case letters. |
| **Binary.ipv4-addr** | JSON **string** containing the text representation of an IPv4 address as specified in Section 3 of "Textual Representation of IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses" [TEXTREP]. |
| **Binary.ipv6-addr** | JSON **string** containing the text representation of an IPv6 address as specified in Section 4 of RFC 5952. |
| **Boolean** | JSON **true** or **false** |
| **Integer** | JSON **number** |
| **Number** | JSON **number** |
| **Null** | JSON **null** |
| **String** | JSON **string** |
| **Array** | JSON **array** |
| **Array.ipv4-net** | JSON **string** containing the text representation of an IPv4 address range as specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 4632. |
| **Array.ipv6-net** | JSON **string** containing the text representation of an IPv6 address range as specified in Section 2.3 of RFC 4291. | 
| **ArrayOf** | JSON **array** |
| **Choice** | JSON **object** with one member.  Member key is the field name.   |
| Choice.ID | JSON **object** with one member. Member key is the integer field id converted to string. |
| **Enumerated** | JSON **string** |
| **Enumerated.ID** | JSON **integer** |
| **Map** | JSON **object**. Member keys are field names. |
| **Map.ID** | JSON **object**. Member keys are integer field ids converted to strings. |
| **Record** | JSON **object**. Member keys are field names. |

#### 3.1.5.1 ID and Name Serialization
Instances of Enumerated types and keys for Choice and Map types are serialized as ID values except when using serialization formats intended for human consumption, where Name strings are used instead.  Defining a type using ".ID" appended to the base type (e.g., Enumerated.ID, Map.ID) indicates that:

1. Type definitions and application values use only the ID.  There is no corresponding name except as an optional part of the description.
2. Instances of Enumerated values and Choice/Map keys are serialized as IDs regardless of serialization format.

#### 3.1.5.2 Integer Serialization
For machine-to-machine serialization formats, integers are represented as binary data, e.g., 32 bits, 128 bits.   But for human-readable serialization formats (XML and JSON), integers are converted to strings.  For example, the JSON "number" type represents integers and real numbers as decimal strings without quotes, e.g., { "height": 68.2 }, and as noted in RFC 7493 Section 2.2, a sender cannot expect a receiver to treat an integer with an absolute value greater than 2^^53 as an exact value.

The default representation of Integer types in text serializations is the native integer type for that format, e.g., "number" for JSON.   Integer fields with a range larger than the IEEE 754 exact range (e.g., 64, 128, 2048 bit values) are indicated by appending ".<bit-size>" or ".*" to the type, e.g. Integer.64 or Integer.*.  All serializations ensure that large Integer types are transferred exactly, for example in the same manner as Binary types.  Integer values support arithmetic operations; Binary values are not intended for that purpose.

## 3.2 Message
As described in Section 1.1, this language specification and one or more actuator profiles define the content of OpenC2 commands and responses, while transfer specifications define the on-the-wire format of a message over specific secure transport protocols.  Transfer specifications are agnostic with regard to content, and content is agnostic with regard to transfer protocol.  This decoupling is accomplished by defining a standard message interface used to transfer any type of content over any transfer protocol.

A message is a content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between consumers and producers.  To ensure interoperability all transfer specifications must unambiguously define how the message elements in [Table 3-1](#table-3-1-common-message-elements) are represented within the secure transport protocol. This does not imply that all message elements must be used in all messages.  Content, content_type, and msg_type are required, while other message elements are not required by this specification but may be required by other documents.

###### Table 3-1. Common Message Elements

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |
| **content_type** | String. Media Type that identifies the format of the content, including major version. Incompatible content formats must have different content_types.  Content_type **application/openc2** identifies content defined by OpenC2 language specification versions 1.x, i.e., all versions that are compatible with version 1.0. |
| **msg_type** | Message-Type. One of **request**, **response**, or **notification**.  For the **application/openc2** content_type the request content is an OpenC2-Command and the response content is an OpenC2-Response.  OpenC2 does not currently define any notification content. |
| **status** | Status-Code.  Populated with a numeric status code in response messages.  Not present in request or notification messages. |
| **request_id** | Request-Id. A unique identifier value of up to 128 bits that is attached to request and response messages. This value is assigned by the sender and is copied unmodified into all responses to support  reference to a particular command, transaction or event chain. |
| **created** | Date-Time. Creation date/time of the content, the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970. |
| **from** | String. Authenticated identifier of the creator of or authority for execution of a message. |
| **to** | ArrayOf(String). Authenticated identifier(s) of the authorized recipient(s) of a message. |

Implementations may use environment variables, private APIs, data structures, class instances, pointers, or other mechanisms to represent messages within the local environment.  However the internal representation of a message does not affect interoperability and is therefore beyond the scope of OpenC2.  This means that the message content is a data structure in whatever form is used within an implementation, not a serialized representation of that structure.  Content is the input provided to a serializer or the output of a de-serializer.  Msg_type is a three-element enumeration whose protocol representation is defined in each transfer spec, for example as a string, an integer, or a two-bit field.  The internal form of enumerations, like content, does not affect interoperability and is therefore unspecified.

## 3.3 Content
The scope of this specification is to define the ACTION and TARGET portions of an OpenC2 command and the common portions of an OpenC2 response.  The properties of the OpenC2 command are defined in [Section 3.3.1](#331-openc2-command) and the properties of the response are defined in [Section 3.3.2](#332-openc2-response).

In addition to the ACTION and TARGET, an OpenC2 command has an optional ACTUATOR. Other than identification of namespace identifier, the semantics associated with the ACTUATOR specifiers are beyond the scope of this specification.  The actuators and actuator-specific results contained in a response are specified in âActuator Profile Specificationsâ such as StateLess Packet Filtering Profile, Routing Profile etc.

### 3.3.1 OpenC2 Command
The OpenC2 Command describes an action performed on a target.

### 3.3.3 Imported Data
In addition to the targets, actuators, arguments, and other language elements defined in this specification, OpenC2 messages may contain data objects imported from other specifications and/or custom data objects defined by the implementers.  The details are specified in a data profile which contains:

1. a prefix indicating the origin of the imported data object is outside OpenC2:
    * `x_` (profile)
2. a unique name for the specification being imported, e.g.:
    * For shortname `x_kmipv2.0` the full name would be `oasis-open.org/openc2/profiles/kmip-v2.0, `
    * For shortname `x_sfslpf` the full name would be `sfractal.com/slpf/v1.1/x_slpf-profile-v1.1`
3. a namespace identifier (nsid) - a short reference, e.g., `kmipv2.0`, to the unique name of the specification
4. a list of object identifiers imported from that specification, e.g., `Credential`
5. a definition of each imported object, either referenced or contained in the profile
6. conformance requirements for implementations supporting the profile

The data profile itself can be the specification being imported or the data profile can reference an existing specification.  In the example above, the data profile created by the OpenC2 TC to represent KMIP could have a unique name of `oasis-open.org/openc2/profiles/kmip-v2.0`.  The data profile would note that it is derived from the original specification `oasis-open.org/kmip/spec/v2.0/kmip-spec-v2.0`. In the example for shortname `x_sfslpf`, the profile itself could be defined in a manner directly compatible with OpenC2 and would not reference any other specification.

An imported object is identified by namespace identifier and object identifier. While the data profile may offer a suggested nsid, the containing schema defines the nsids that it uses to refer to objects imported from other specifications:

```
import oasis-open.org/openc2/profiles/kmip-v2.0 as x_kmip_2.0
```

An element using an imported object identifies it using the nsid:

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

A data profile can define its own schema for imported objects, or it can reference content as defined in the specification being imported.  Defining an abstract syntax allows imported objects to be represented in the same format as the containing object.  Referencing content directly from an imported specification results in it being treated as an opaque blob if the imported and containing formats are not the same (e.g., an XML or TLV object imported into a JSON OpenC2 command, or a STIX JSON object imported into a CBOR OpenC2 command).

The OpenC2 Language MAY be extended using imported data objects for TARGET, TARGET_SPECIFIER, ACTUATOR, ACTUATOR_SPECIFIER, ARGUMENTS, and RESULTS. The list of ACTIONS in Section 3.2.1.2 SHALL NOT be extended.

### 3.3.4 Extensions
Organizations may extend the functionality of OpenC2 by defining organization-specific profiles. OpenC2 defines two methods for defining organization-specific profiles: using a registered namespace or an unregistered namespace. Organizations wishing to create non-standardized OpenC2 profiles SHOULD use a registered Private Enterprise Number namespace.  Private Enterprise Numbers are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as described in RFC 5612, for example:

* 32473
  * Example Enterprise Number for Documentation Use
    * See [RFC5612]
      * iana&iana.org

OpenC2 contains four predefined extension points to support registered private enterprise profiles: PE-Target, PE-Specifiers, PE-Args, and PE-Results.  An organization can develop a profile that defines custom types, create an entry for their organization's namespace under each extension point used in the profile, and then use their custom types within OpenC2 commands and responses.

By convention ID values of 1000 and above within OpenC2-defined data types are namespace identifiers, although there is no restriction against assigning non-namespaced IDs in that range.

This is an example target from a registered profile containing a "lens" extension defined by the organization with IANA Private Enterprise Number 32473. This hypothetical target might be used with the "set" action to support an IoT camera pan-tilt-zoom use case. This example is for illustrative purposes only and MUST NOT use this in actual implementations. 

```
{
    "target": {
        "extension": {
            "32473": {
                "lens": {"focal_length": 240, "aperture": "f/1.6"}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is an example of the same target from a profile defined by an organization that has not registered a Private Enterprise Number with IANA.  This example is for illustrative purposes only and MUST NOT use this in actual implementations.

```
{
    "target": {
        "unregistered": {
            "x-foo.com": {
                "lens": {"focal_length": 240, "aperture": "f/1.6"}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Using DNS names provides collision resistance for names used in x- namespaces, but the corresponding IDs are not coordinated through a registration process and are subject to collisions.

OpenC2 implementations MAY support registered and unregistered extension profiles regardless of whether those profiles are listed by OASIS.  Implementations MUST NOT use the "Example" registered extension entries shown below, and MAY use one or more actual registered extensions by replacing the example entries.

#### 3.3.4.1 Private Enterprise Target
Because target is a required element, implementations receiving an OpenC2 Command with an unsupported target type MUST reject the command as invalid.

**_Type: PE-Target (Choice.ID)_**

| ID | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

#### 3.4.1.x IPv4 Address Range
As stated in Section 3.1.1, all OpenC2 data types are defined abstractly, independently of both how they are represented within an application and how they are communicated between applications.  The critical distinction is that an abstract type represents what an item **is**, not how it is implemented.

Two criteria are used to determine what an item **is**:
1. Is there a *standard* that defines the item, and if so, what does the standard say, and
2. Is the definition *unambiguous*, i.e. how easy is it to determine if an instance of that item is valid.

The IPv4 standard [RFC791] defines what an IPv4 address **is** - a 32 bit number. [TEXTREP], an Internet-Draft that expired in 2005, is the most authoritative definition available for the **"Textual Representation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses"**.

By criterion 1, both documents agree that an IPv4 address is a 32 bit Binary value, not a String, and the abstract definition of IPv4-Address is based on those standards.  And by criterion 2, defining an IPv4 Address to be a 32 bit value is entirely unambiguous - it is trivial to determine if an instance is valid, and there is no disagreement among implementations.  By comparison, determining if a String fits the definition in [TEXTREP] is not as trivial.  The ABNF definition is 7 lines of text that requires a bit of thought to interpret, and most implementations do not even follow the ABNF.  Is "129.034.215.162" a valid IP address? If so, explain why, and if not, explain why not.

By the same logic, an IPv4 address range **is not** an IPv4 address. The standard "Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan" [RFC4632] defines what the address range **is**:
> "the "/16" indicating that the mask to extract the network portion of the prefix is a 32-bit value where the most
   significant 16 bits are ones and the least significant 16 bits are zeros."

and how it is **shown** in CIDR notation:
> "a 4-octet quantity followed by the "/" (slash) character, followed by a decimal value between 0 and 32".

The abstract definition of an address range is the two parts defined by the standard. The serialization rule "Array.ipv4-net" says that it is transmitted between applications as a single string in CIDR notation.  Neither the type definition nor the serialization rule says anything about how implementations represent an IPv4 address range internally - they may use strings or any other variables or classes as they see fit.

# 4 Mandatory Commands/Responses 
An OpenC2 command consists of an ACTION/TARGET pair and associated SPECIFIERS and ARGUMENTs.  This section enumerates the allowed commands, identify which are required or optional to implement, and present the associated responses.  

An OpenC2 Consumer MUST process an OpenC2 Command where "query" is specified for the ACTION and "features" is specified for the TARGET, hereafter, referred to as a 'query features' command".

Upon processing a 'query features'  command, an OpenC2 Consumer MUST issue an OpenC2 Response to the OpenC2 Producer that issued the OpenC2 Command.

-------

# 5 Conformance
## 5.1 OpenC2 Message Content
A conformant OpenC2 Command 

1. MUST be structured in accordance with Section 3.4.1, and 
2. MUST include exactly one ACTION specified in Section 3.4.1.1.

A conformant OpenC2 Response

1. MUST be structured in accordance with Section 3.4.2, and 
2. MUST include exactly one STATUS specified in Section 3.4.2.1.

## 5.2 OpenC2 Producer
A conformant OpenC2 Producer 

1. MUST issue OpenC2 Commands and process OpenC2 Responses specified in Section 4
2. MUST implement JSON serialization of generated OpenC2 Commands in accordance with RFC 7493

## 5.3 OpenC2 Consumer
A conformant OpenC2 Consumer 

1. MUST process OpenC2 Commands and issue OpenC2 Responses specified in Section 4
2. MUST implement JSON serialization of generated OpenC2 Responses in accordance with RFC 7493

-------

# Annex A. Schemas
This annex defines the information model used by conforming OpenC2 implementations in JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) format.  JADN is a structured textual representation of the tables shown in Section 3.  Schema files referenced by the URLs include descriptive text shown in the tables.  Descriptions are omitted from the figures in this section in order to: 1) illustrate that descriptive text is not part of the language syntax, 2) show what an actuator would return in response to a schema query, and 3) improve readability of the figures. 

## A.1 OpenC2 Language Syntax

# Annex B. Examples
## B.1 Example 1
This example shows the elements of an OpenC2 Message containing an OpenC2 Command. The content of the message is the de-serialized command structure in whatever format is used by the implementation, independent of the transfer protocol and serialization format used to transport the message.

The request_id in this example is a 64 bit binary value which can be displayed in many ways, including hex:` 'd937 fca9 2b64 4e71'`,  base64url: `'2Tf8qStkTnE'`, and Python byte string - ASCII characters with hex escapes (\xNN) for non-ASCII bytes: `b'\xd97\xfc\xa9+dNq'`.  If OpenC2 producers generate numeric or alphanumeric request_ids, they are still binary values and are limited to 128 bits, e.g.,: hex: '6670 2d31 3932 352d 3337 3632 3864 3663', base64url: 'ZnAtMTkyNS0zNzYyOGQ2Yw', byte string: b'fp-1925-37628d6c'.

The created element is a Date-Time value of milliseconds since the epoch.  The example `1539355895215` may be displayed as` '12 October 2018 14:51:35 UTC'`.

This example, illustrating an internal representation of a message, is non-normative.  Other programming languages (e.g., Java, Javascript, C, Erlang) have different representations of literal values.  There are no interoperability considerations or conformance requirements for how message elements are represented internally within an implementation.  Only the serialized values of the message elements embedded within a protocol is relevant to interoperability.


### B.1.1 Command Message
content-type: 'application/openc2'
msg_type: 'request'
request_id: b'\xd97\xfc\xa9+dNq'
from: 'nocc-3497'
to: ['#filter-devices']
created: 1539355895215
content: {'action': 'query', 'target': {'features': ['versions', 'profiles']}}

### B.1.2 Response Message
The response message contains a status code, a content-type that is normally the same as the request content type, a msg_type of `'response'`, and the response content.  The request_id from the command message, if present, is returned unchanged in the response message.  The "to" element of the response normally echoes the "from" element of the command message, but the "from" element of the response is the actuator's identifier regardless of whether the command was sent to an individual actuator or a group.  The "created" element, if present, contains the creation time of the response.

A responder could potentially return non-openc2 content, such as a PDF report or an HTML document, in response to an openc2 command.  No actuator profiles currently define response content types other than openc2.

status: 200
content-type: 'application/openc2'
msg_type: 'response'
request_id: b'\xd97\xfc\xa9+dNq'
from: 'pf72394'
to: ['nocc-3497']
created: 1539355898000
content: {'status': 200, 'versions': ['1.3'], 'profiles': ['oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-slpf']}

## B.2 Example 2
This example is for a transport where the header information is outside the JSON (e.g., HTTPS API) and only body is in JSON.

**Command:**

```
{
    "action": "query",
    "target": {
        "properties": ["battery_percentage"]
    },
    "actuator": {
        "esm": {
            "asset_id": "TGEadsasd"
        }
    }:
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "kvps": [["battery_percentage", "0.577216"]]
}
```

## B.3 Example 3
**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "features": ["versions", "profiles"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "status_text": "ACME Corp Internet Toaster",
  "versions": ["1.0"],
  "profiles": []
}
```

**Command:**

This command queries the actuator for the syntax of its supported commands.

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "features": ["pairs", "schema"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

This example illustrates how actuator developers tailor the OpenC2 schema to communicate the capabilities of their products to producers.  This example actuator supports the mandatory requirements of the language specification plus a random subset of optional language elements (cancel, create, and delete actions, and the command, ip_addr, and properties targets).  The example actuator supports a subset of the core OpenC2 language but no profile-defined targets, actuator specifiers, command arguments, or responses.

The example do-nothing actuator appears to support create and delete  ip_addr commands, but without a profile there is no definition of what the actuator would do to "create" an IP address.  The schema is used by producers to determine what commands are syntactically valid for an actuator, but it does not assign meaning to those commands.
