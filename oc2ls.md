#### Abstract:
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyberdefense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine to machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. It should be understood that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated cyber responses that occur within cyber relevant time. Other aspects of coordinated cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.

# 1 Introduction
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a Command is encoded by a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a _Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol. The Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.  The contents of both the _Command_ and the _Response_ are fully defined in schemas, allowing both parties to recognize the syntax constraints imposed on the exchange.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices.  These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device.  The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.2 Terminology
* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed.
* **Actuator**: The entity that performs the action.
* **Command**: A message defined by an action-target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands.  Note that a single device / application can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received request.
* **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is performed on the Target.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] and [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)].

## 1.6 Overview
OpenC2 is a suite of specifications to command actuators that execute cyber defense functions in an unambiguous, standardized way.  These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications.  The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the standard at the Producer and Consumer of the Command and Response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.

* The OpenC2 Language Specification provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for Commands and Responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the Command or Response.
* OpenC2 Actuator Profiles specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific Actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely) to implement multiple Actuator profiles.  Actuator profiles define the requirements for performing a specific function, and may define new language elements if needed to perform that function.
* OpenC2 Transfer Specifications utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transfer of OpenC2 messages.

The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components.  A message consists of a header and a payload (_defined_ as a message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and _specified_ in one or more Actuator profiles). 

In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:

1. **Producer**: A Producer is an entity that creates Commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the Command. A Producer may receive and process Responses in conjunction with a Command.
2. **Consumer**: A Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon a Command.  A Consumer may create Responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the Producer. 

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the Producer, to one or more systems, the Consumer(s), to act on the content of the Command.
2. **Response**: Any information captured or necessary to send back to the Producer that issued the Command, i.e., the Consumerâs Response to the Producer.

**Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude the use of any particular protocol or standard.

![no alt title](images/image_2.png)

**Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.

**Table 1-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>(standard and extension) |
| Common Content | Language Specification<br>(this document) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>(OpenC2-over-HTTPS, OpenC2-over-CoAP, â¦) |
| Secure Transfer | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transfer** layer provides a communication path between the Producer and the Consumer.  OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transfer protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transfer- and content-independent mechanism for conveying requests, responses, and notifications.  A transfer specification maps transfer-specific protocol elements to a transfer-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.  
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of Commands and Responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function.  An Actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function. Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.

## 1.7 Goal
The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD](#iacd)]:

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action 

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions.  OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/ analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guides the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and product agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  A Command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  Commands and Responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While the OpenC2 language defines a core set of Actions and Targets for cyber defense, it supports separate definition of additional language elements to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

## 1.8 Purpose and Scope
The OpenC2 Language Specification defines the set of components to assemble a complete command and control message and provides a framework so that the language can be extended. To achieve this purpose, the scope of this specification includes:

1. the set of Actions and options that may be used in Commands
2. the set of Targets and Target specifiers
3. a syntax that defines the structure of Commands and Responses
4. a JSON serialization of Commands and Responses
5. the procedures for extending the language

The OpenC2 language assumes that the event has been detected, a decision to act has been made, the act is warranted, and the initiator and recipient of the Commands are authenticated and authorized. The OpenC2 language was designed to be agnostic of the other aspects of cyber defense implementations that realize these assumptions. The following items are beyond the scope of this specification:

1. Language elements applicable to some Actuators, which may be defined in individual Actuator profiles.
2. Alternate serializations of Commands and Responses.
3. The enumeration of the protocols required for transport, information assurance, sensing, analytics and other external dependencies.

# 2 OpenC2 Language Description
The OpenC2 language has two distinct content types: Command and Response. The Command is sent from a Producer to a Consumer and describes an Action to be performed by an Actuator on a Target. The Response is sent from a Consumer, usually back to the Producer, and is a means to provide information (such as acknowledgement, status, etc.) as a result of a Command.

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command
The Command describes an Action to be performed on a Target and may include information identifying the Actuator or Actuators that are to execute the Command. 

A Command has four main components: ACTION, TARGET, ARGUMENTS, and ACTUATOR. The following list summarizes the components of a Command. 

* **ACTION** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **TARGET** (required): The object of the action. The ACTION is performed on the TARGET.
    * **TARGET-NAME** (required): The name of the object of the Action.
    * **TARGET-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier further identifies the Target to some level of precision, such as a specific Target, a list of Targets, or a class of Targets.
* **ARGUMENTS** (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration etc.
* **ACTUATOR** (optional): The ACTUATOR executes the Command (the ACTION and TARGET). The ACTUATOR type will be defined within the context of an Actuator Profile.
    * **ACTUATOR-NAME** (required): The name of the set of functions (e.g., "slpf") performed by the Actuator, and the name of the profile defining Commands applicable to those functions.
    * **ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier identifies the Actuator to some level of precision, such as a specific Actuator, a list of Actuators, or a group of Actuators.

The ACTION and TARGET components are required and are populated by one of the Actions in [Section 3.3.1.1](#3311-action) and the Targets in [Section 3.3.1.2](#3312-target). A particular Target may be further refined by one or more TARGET-SPECIFIERS. Procedures to extend the Targets are described in [Section 3.3.3](#334-extensions).

TARGET-SPECIFIERS provide additional precision to identify the Target (e.g., 10.1.2.3) and may include a method of identifying multiple Targets of the same type (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16).

The ARGUMENTS component, if present, is populated by one or more 'command arguments' that determine how the Command is executed. ARGUMENTS influence the Command by providing information such as time, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to convey the need for acknowledgement or additional status information about the execution of a Command. The valid ARGUMENTS defined in this specification are in [Section 3.3.1.4](#3314-command-arguments).

An ACTUATOR is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the Command. An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of ACTIONS, TARGETS and other aspects of this language specification that are required or optional in the context of a particular ACTUATOR. An Actuator Profile may extend the language by defining additional ARGUMENTS, ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS, and/or TARGETS that are meaningful and possibly unique to the Actuator.

The ACTUATOR optionally identifies the entity or entities that are tasked to execute the Command. Specifiers for Actuators refine the Command so that a particular function, system, class of devices, or specific device can be identified. 

The ACTUATOR component may be omitted from a Command and typically will not be included in implementations where the identities of the endpoints are unambiguous or when a high-level effects-based Command is desired and the tactical decisions on how the effect is achieved is left to the recipient.  

## 2.2 OpenC2 Response
The Response is a message sent from the recipient of a Command. Response messages provide acknowledgement, status, results from a query, or other information.

The following list summarizes the fields and subfields of a Response. 

* **STATUS** (required): An integer containing a numerical status code
* **STATUS_TEXT** (optional): A free-form string containing human-readable description of the Response status. The string can contain more detail than is represented by the status code, but does not affect the meaning of the Response.
* **RESULTS** (optional): Contains the data or extended status code that was requested from a Command.

| Binary | A sequence of octets.  Length is the number of octets. |
| Boolean | A logical entity that can have two values: `true` and `false`. |
| Integer | A whole number. |
| Number | A real number. |
| Null | Nothing, used to designate fields with no value. |
| String | A sequence of characters. Each character must have a valid Unicode codepoint.  Length is the number of characters. |
| **Structures** |   |
| Array | An ordered list of unnamed fields. Each field has an ordinal position and a type. |
| ArrayOf(*vtype*) | An ordered list of unnamed fields. Each field has an ordinal position and its value has type *vtype*. |
| Choice | One field selected from a set of named fields. The value has a name and a type. |
| Choice.ID | One field selected from a set of fields.  The API value has an id and a type. |
| Enumerated | A set of named integral constants. The API value is a name. |
| Enumerated.ID | A set of unnamed integral constants. The API value is an id. |
| Map | An unordered set of named fields. Each field has an id, name and type. |
| Map.ID | An unordered set of fields.  The API value of each field has an id and type. |
| Record | An ordered list of named fields, e.g. an OrderedMap, structure, or row in a table. Each field has an ordinal position, name, and type. |

* **API** values do not affect interoperabilty, and although they must exhibit the characteristics specified above, their representation within applications is unspecified.  A Python application might represent the Map type as a dict variable, a javascript application might represent it as an object literal or an ES6 Map type, and a C# application might represent it as a Dictionary or a Hashtable.

* **Serialized** values are critical to interoperability, and this document defines a set of **serialization rules** that unambiguously define how each of the above types are serialized using a human-friendly JSON format.  Other serialization rules, such as for XML, machine-optimized JSON, and CBOR formats, exist but are out of scope for this document.  Both the format-specific serialization rules in Section 3.1.5 and the format-agnostic type definitions in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are Normative.

Types defined with an ".ID" suffix (Choice.ID, Enumerated.ID, Map.ID) are equivalent to the non-suffixed types except:

1. Field definitions and API values are identified only by ID.  The non-normative description may include a suggested name.
2. Serialized values of Enumerated types and keys of Choice/Map types are IDs regardless of serialization format.

OpenC2 type definitions are presented in table format. All table columns except Description are Normative. The Description column is always Non-normative.

For types without individual field definitions (Primitive types and ArrayOf), the type definition includes the name of the type being defined and the definition of that type. This table defines a type called *Email-Addr* that is a *String* that has a semantic value constraint of *email*:

| Type Name | Type Definition | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Email-Addr** | String (email) | Email address |

For Structure types, the definition includes the name of the type being defined, the built-in type on which it is based, and options applicable to the type as a whole.  This is followed by a table defining each of the fields in the structure.  This table defines a type called *Args* that is a *Map* containing at least one field.  Each of the fields has an integer Tag/ID, a Name, and a Type.  Each field in this definition is optional (Multiplicity = 0..1), but per the type definition at least one must be present.

**_Type: Args (Map) [1..*]_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **start_time** | Date-Time | 0..1 | The specific date/time to initiate the action  |
| 2 | **stop_time** | Date-Time | 0..1 | The specific date/time to terminate the action |
| 3 | **duration** | Duration | 0..1 | The length of time for an action to be in effect |

The field columns present in a structure definition depends on the base type:

| Base Type | Field Definition Columns |
| :--- | :--- |
| Enumerated.ID | ID, Description |
| Enumerated | ID, Name, Description |
| Array, Choice.ID, Map.ID | ID, Type, Multiplicity (#), Description |
| Choice, Map, Record | ID, Name, Type, Multiplicity (#), Description |

The ID column of Array and Record types contains the ordinal position of the field, numbered sequentially starting at 1.  The ID column of Choice, Enumerated, and Map types contains tags with arbitrary integer values. IDs and Names are unique within each type definition.

### 3.1.2 Semantic Value Constraints
Structural validation alone may be insufficient to validate that an instance meets all the requirements of an application. Semantic validation keywords specify value constraints for which an authoritative definition exists.

| Keyword | Applies to Type | Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **email** | String | Value must be an email address as defined in RFC 5322, section 3.4.1 |
| **hostname** | String | Value must be a hostname as defined in RFC 1034 section 3.1 |
| **uri** | String | Value must be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as defined in RFC 3986 |
| **eui** | Binary | Value must be an EUI-48 or EUI-64 as defined in EUI |

### 3.1.3 Multiplicity
Property tables for types based on Array, Choice, Map and Record include a multiplicity column (#) that specifies the minimum and maximum cardinality (number of elements) of a field.  As used in the Unified Modeling Language ([UML](#uml)), typical examples of multiplicity are:

| Multiplicity | Description | Keywords |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Exactly one instance | Required |
| 0..1 | No instances or one instance | Optional |
| 1..* | At least one instance | Required, Repeatable |
| 0..* | Zero or more instances | Optional, Repeatable |
| m..n | At least m but no more than n instances | Required, Repeatable |

When used with a Type, multiplicity is enclosed in square brackets, e.g.,:

| Type Name | Base Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Features** | ArrayOf(Feature) [0..10] | An array of zero to ten names used to query an actuator for its supported capabilities. |

### 3.1.4 Derived Enumerations
An Enumerated field may be derived ("auto-generated") from the fields of a Choice, Map or Record type by appending ".*" to the type name.

**_Type: Example-sel (Record)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | targets | Target.* | 1..* | Enumeration auto-generated from a Choice |

### 3.1.5 Imported Types
Each Actuator profile defines a *base schema* - the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions.  Each profile has a unique name used to unambiguously identify the profile document (and it's base schema).

In addition, a profile may define profile-specific types that are *imported* by its base schema. Type definitions are imported under a *namespace* to allow profiles to be developed independently and their definitions brought together into a single merged schema without risk of ambiguity or name collisions. A namespace consists of:

* The unique name of the schema being imported
* A short namespace identifier (**nsid**) assigned locally within the base schema to refer to the unique name

In this document, type definitions are represented as tables and importing is a conceptual process.  When using a schema language, importing is an actual process that takes a base schema and a set of imported schemas as inputs and produces a single merged schema as output. In both cases the base schema locally assigns a namespace identifier to each schema that it imports, and importing a schema means prepending the namespace identifier to all type names defined in that schema.

The OpenC2 Language MAY be extended using imported data objects for TARGET, TARGET_SPECIFIER, ACTUATOR, ACTUATOR_SPECIFIER, ARGUMENTS, and RESULTS. The list of ACTIONS in Section 3.2.1.2 SHALL NOT be extended.

Producers and Consumers MUST support the syntax defined by the merged schema, regardless of whether the implementation is based on conceptually merging tables from a set of documents or physically merging a set of schema files.

**Example - Import a Schema**

Assume that a schema being imported includes the following type definitions:

**_Type: Target (Choice)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **device** | Device | 1 | |

**_Type: Device (Map)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **model** | String | 0..1 | |
| 2 | **manufacturer** | String | 0..1 | |

After conceptually importing that schema under the "abc" namespace identifier, the base schema would be interpreted as if it contained the following definitions:

**_Type: abc:Target (Choice)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **device** | abc:Device | 1 | |

**_Type: abc:Device (Map)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **model** | String | 0..1 | |
| 2 | **manufacturer** | String | 0..1 | |

A Consumer lists the profiles it supports in response to the "query features imports" command. The Producer then knows the unique names of all imported profiles and the nsids assigned to each profile by that Consumer. The Target type defined in the profile's base schema contains a subset of the Target fields defined in this document, plus a field for each imported profile:

**_Type: Target (Choice)_**

| ID | Name | Type | # | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **artifact** | Artifact | 1 | An array of bytes representing a file-like object or a link to that object. |
| 3 | **device** | Device | 1 | The properties of a hardware device. |
| 7 | **domain_name** | Domain-Name | 1 | A network domain name. |
| 1030 | **abc** | abc:Target | 1 | Imported targets defined in the "abc" profile |

The **device** target and the **abc** target have different Types, and even though the combined schema includes type definitions for both Device and abc:Device, those definitions do not conflict.

The ID and Name of a field whose Type is imported are arbitrary, but because there may not be a way for a Producer to determine the schema used by a Consumer, the field Name assigned to an imported type SHOULD equal the nsid of that type. 

### 3.1.6 Serialization
OpenC2 is agnostic of any particular serialization; however, implementations MUST support JSON serialization in accordance with RFC 7493 and additional requirements specified in the following table.

**JSON Serialization Requirements:**

| OpenC2 Data Type | JSON Serialization Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Binary** | JSON **string** containing Base64url encoding of the binary value as defined in Section 5 of RFC 4648. |
| **Boolean** | JSON **true** or **false** |
| **Integer** | JSON **number** |
| **Number** | JSON **number** |
| **Null** | JSON **null** |
| **String** | JSON **string** |
| **Array** | JSON **array** |
| **ArrayOf** | JSON **array** |
| **Choice** | JSON **object** with one member.  Member key is the field name.   |
| **Choice.ID** | JSON **object** with one member. Member key is the integer field id converted to string. |
| **Enumerated** | JSON **string** |
| **Enumerated.ID** | JSON **integer** |
| **Map** | JSON **object**. Member keys are field names. |
| **Map.ID** | JSON **object**. Member keys are integer field ids converted to strings. |
| **Record** | JSON **object**. Member keys are field names. |

#### 3.1.6.1 ID and Name Serialization
Instances of Enumerated types and keys for Choice and Map types are serialized as ID values except when using serialization formats intended for human consumption, where Name strings are used instead.  Defining a type using ".ID" appended to the base type (e.g., Enumerated.ID, Map.ID) indicates that:

1. Type definitions and application values use only the ID.  There is no corresponding name except as an optional part of the description.
2. Instances of Enumerated values and Choice/Map keys are serialized as IDs regardless of serialization format.

#### 3.1.6.2 Integer Serialization
For machine-to-machine serialization formats, integers are represented as binary data, e.g., 32 bits, 128 bits.   But for human-readable serialization formats (XML and JSON), integers are converted to strings.  For example, the JSON "number" type represents integers and real numbers as decimal strings without quotes, e.g., { "height": 68.2 }, and as noted in RFC 7493 Section 2.2, a sender cannot expect a receiver to treat an integer with an absolute value greater than 2^^53 as an exact value.

The default representation of Integer types in text serializations is the native integer type for that format, e.g., "number" for JSON.   Integer fields with a range larger than the IEEE 754 exact range (e.g., 64, 128, 2048 bit values) are indicated by appending ".<bit-size>" or ".*" to the type, e.g. Integer.64 or Integer.*.  All serializations ensure that large Integer types are transferred exactly, for example in the same manner as Binary types.  Integer values support arithmetic operations; Binary values are not intended for that purpose.

## 3.2 Message
As described in Section 1.1, this language specification and one or more Actuator profiles define the content of Commands and Responses, while transfer specifications define the on-the-wire format of a message over specific secure transport protocols.  Transfer specifications are agnostic with regard to content, and content is agnostic with regard to transfer protocol.  This decoupling is accomplished by defining a standard message interface used to transfer any type of content over any transfer protocol.

A message is a content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.  To ensure interoperability all transfer specifications must unambiguously define how the message elements in [Table 3-1](#table-3-1-common-message-elements) are represented within the secure transport protocol. This does not imply that all message elements must be used in all messages.  Content, content_type, and msg_type are required, while other message elements are not required by this specification but may be required by other documents.

###### Table 3-1. Common Message Elements

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |
| **content_type** | String. Media Type that identifies the format of the content, including major version. Incompatible content formats must have different content_types.  Content_type **application/openc2** identifies content defined by OpenC2 language specification versions 1.x, i.e., all versions that are compatible with version 1.0. |
| **msg_type** | Message-Type. One of **request**, **response**, or **notification**.  For the **application/openc2** content_type the request content is an OpenC2-Command and the Response content is an OpenC2-Response.  OpenC2 does not currently define any notification content. |
| **status** | Status-Code.  Populated with a numeric status code in Response messages.  Not present in request or notification messages. |
| **request_id** | Request-Id. A unique identifier value of up to 128 bits that is attached to request and Response messages. This value is assigned by the sender and is copied unmodified into all Responses to support  reference to a particular Command, transaction or event chain. |
| **created** | Date-Time. Creation date/time of the content, the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970. |
| **from** | String. Authenticated identifier of the creator of or authority for execution of a message. |
| **to** | ArrayOf(String). Authenticated identifier(s) of the authorized recipient(s) of a message. |

Implementations may use environment variables, private APIs, data structures, class instances, pointers, or other mechanisms to represent messages within the local environment.  However the internal representation of a message does not affect interoperability and is therefore beyond the scope of OpenC2.  This means that the message content is a data structure in whatever form is used within an implementation, not a serialized representation of that structure.  Content is the input provided to a serializer or the output of a de-serializer.  Msg_type is a three-element enumeration whose protocol representation is defined in each transfer spec, for example as a string, an integer, or a two-bit field.  The internal form of enumerations, like content, does not affect interoperability and is therefore unspecified.

## 3.3 Content
The purpose of this specification is to define the ACTION and TARGET portions of a Command and the common portions of a Response.  The properties of the Command are defined in [Section 3.3.1](#331-openc2-command) and the properties of the Response are defined in [Section 3.3.2](#332-openc2-response).

In addition to the ACTION and TARGET, a Command has an optional ACTUATOR. Other than identification of namespace identifier, the semantics associated with the Actuator specifiers are defined in Actuator Profiles. The Actuators and Actuator-specific results contained in a Response are specified in âActuator Profile Specificationsâ such as StateLess Packet Filtering Profile, Routing Profile etc.

### 3.3.1 OpenC2 Command

# 4 Required Commands/Responses 
An OpenC2 Command consists of an ACTION/TARGET pair and associated SPECIFIERS and ARGUMENTs.  This section enumerates the allowed commands, identify which are required or optional to implement, and present the associated responses.  

A Consumer MUST process a Command where "query" is specified for the ACTION and "features" is specified for the TARGET, hereafter, referred to as a 'query features' Command".

Upon processing a 'query features' Command, an Consumer MUST issue a Response to the Producer that issued the Command.

-------

# 5 Conformance
## 5.1 Message Content
A conformant Command 

1. MUST be structured in accordance with Section 3.4.1, and 
2. MUST include exactly one ACTION specified in Section 3.4.1.1.

A conformant Response

1. MUST be structured in accordance with Section 3.4.2, and 
2. MUST include exactly one STATUS specified in Section 3.4.2.1.

## 5.2 Producer
A conformant Producer 

1. MUST issue Commands and process Responses specified in Section 4
2. MUST implement JSON serialization of generated Commands in accordance with RFC 7493

## 5.3 Consumer
A conformant Consumer 

1. MUST process Commands and issue Responses specified in Section 4
2. MUST implement JSON serialization of generated Responses in accordance with RFC 7493

# Annex A. Examples
## A.1 Example 1
This example shows the elements of an OpenC2 Message containing an OpenC2 Command. The content of the message is the de-serialized Command structure in whatever format is used by the implementation, independent of the transfer protocol and serialization format used to transport the message.

The request_id in this example is a 64 bit binary value which can be displayed in many ways, including hex:` 'd937 fca9 2b64 4e71'`,  base64url: `'2Tf8qStkTnE'`, and Python byte string - ASCII characters with hex escapes (\xNN) for non-ASCII bytes: `b'\xd97\xfc\xa9+dNq'`.  If Producers generate numeric or alphanumeric request_ids, they are still binary values and are limited to 128 bits, e.g.,: hex: '6670 2d31 3932 352d 3337 3632 3864 3663', base64url: 'ZnAtMTkyNS0zNzYyOGQ2Yw', byte string: b'fp-1925-37628d6c'.

The created element is a Date-Time value of milliseconds since the epoch.  The example `1539355895215` may be displayed as` '12 October 2018 14:51:35 UTC'`.

This example, illustrating an internal representation of a message, is non-normative.  Other programming languages (e.g., Java, Javascript, C, Erlang) have different representations of literal values.  There are no interoperability considerations or conformance requirements for how message elements are represented internally within an implementation.  Only the serialized values of the message elements embedded within a protocol is relevant to interoperability.


### A.1.1 Command Message
content-type: 'application/openc2'
msg_type: 'request'
request_id: b'\xd97\xfc\xa9+dNq'
from: 'nocc-3497'
to: ['#filter-devices']
created: 1539355895215
content: {'action': 'query', 'target': {'features': ['versions', 'profiles']}}

### A.1.2 Response Message
The response message contains a status code, a content-type that is normally the same as the request content type, a msg_type of `'response'`, and the Response content.  The request_id from the Command message, if present, is returned unchanged in the Response message.  The "to" element of the Response normally echoes the "from" element of the Command message, but the "from" element of the Response is the Actuator's identifier regardless of whether the Command was sent to an individual actuator or a group.  The "created" element, if present, contains the creation time of the Response.

A responder could potentially return non-openc2 content, such as a PDF report or an HTML document, in response to a Command.  No Actuator profiles currently define response content types other than openc2.

status: 200
content-type: 'application/openc2'
msg_type: 'response'
request_id: b'\xd97\xfc\xa9+dNq'
from: 'pf72394'
to: ['nocc-3497']
created: 1539355898000
content: {'status': 200, 'versions': ['1.3'], 'profiles': ['oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-slpf']}

## A.2 Example 2
This example is for a transport where the header information is outside the JSON (e.g., HTTPS API) and only body is in JSON.

**Command:**

```
{
    "action": "query",
    "target": {
        "properties": ["battery_percentage"]
    },
    "actuator": {
        "esm": {
            "asset_id": "TGEadsasd"
        }
    }:
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "kvps": [["battery_percentage", "0.577216"]]
}
```

## A.3 Example 3
**Command:**

```
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "features": ["versions", "profiles"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "status_text": "ACME Corp Internet Toaster",
  "versions": ["1.0"],
  "profiles": []
}
```
